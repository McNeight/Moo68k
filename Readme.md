# Moo68k
## A Motorola 68000 (m68k) emulator in C#. 

Please refer to the [Programmer Reference Manual](https://www.nxp.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf) (M68000PRM.pdf by Motorola) before addressing (pun) an issue.

All references in code are referenced by page number, and article (e.g. `P8-4, 8.2` is page 8-4, article 8.2).

**Note:** The emulator is still a work in progress, not in an useable state.

Irregular updates, no regrets.
