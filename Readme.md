# Moo68k
## A Motorola 68000 (m68k) emulator in C#. 

"Let's make a binary compatible m68k emulator in C#" I said.

A simulator would just try to reproduce behavior, in this case I try to actually emulate an m68k.

Please refer to the [Programmer Reference Manual](https://www.nxp.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf) (M68000PRM.pdf by Motorola) before addressing (get it?) an issue.

**Note:** Not in an useable state.

Irregular updates, no regrets.
