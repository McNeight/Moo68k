Please refer to the [Programmer Reference Manual](https://www.nxp.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf) (M68000PRM.pdf by Motorola) before addressing (pun intended) an issue.

All references in code are referenced by page number, and article from the manual (e.g. `P8-4, 8.2` or `Page 8-4, 8.2` refers to page 8-4, article 8.2).

The wiki will include a list of working instructions.

Please note that the interpreter is filed with bugs, since it is incomplete, so it is not ready for generic use.
